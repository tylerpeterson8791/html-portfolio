# HTML Portfolio
  
  ## Description
  
  This is an older assignment that I didn't submit.  Because of this my motivation was to go back and put myself in the mindset of someone who had just started the class and make a portfolio with only HTML and CSS.
  
  
  ## Installation
  
  I started with the basic outline and files needed.

  Then I created the nav bar.  We didn't have multi-page sites in our repitoire when this was due so I simply have it move the viewpoint to the corresponding section.  For the resume I just did a href to a generic resume.

  I put in a brief history of my work and then made cards to hypothetical projects with a large picture backdrop.

  My contact information is at the bottom as well as a footer to finish the page.
  
  ## Usage

  Here is the link to the deployed page [Deployed Page](https://tylerpeterson8791.github.io/html-portfolio/)
  
  Here is a link to my github repository: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tylerpeterson8791/html-portfolio)
  
  The user begins at the homepage with a picture of me and a brief history of my other work.  Everything is in one page and the user can navigate sections by clicking on the links on the nav bar.

  Almost everything used in this application was learned in class so shout out to Ben and Katy who are the TAs that led this initial section of class while Gary was out.
